**ECG-age for Children**

ECG-age in which the age is estimated from the ECG using neural network is an extension of our newfound obsession with “biological age”. The ECG-age have been validated as a scalable biomarker of cardiovascular risk and associated with many diseases and mortality in recent studies.


However, almost all these studies only focus on adults, and ignore children whose developing heart undergoes continuous change. Whether the existing automatic ECG-age analysis systems which generally trained on the adult ECG dataset is applying for children has not been answered by previous researches.

In this study, a ECG-age mdoel was trained and tested using 58,672 ECG from healthy children aged 0-7 years were collected the Children's hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine.
